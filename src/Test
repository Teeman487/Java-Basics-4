Interface
--------------
An interface in java is a blueprint of a class.
Interface contains finaland static variables.
Interface contains abstract methods.
An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body.
Methods in interface are publicly bydefault.
Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
We can define interface with interface with interface keyword.
A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but a class implememts an interface.
We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.

package is collection of classes/interfaces/other files.
